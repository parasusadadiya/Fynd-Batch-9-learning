    The state of Kerala is a secluded haven for the tourists that are seeking a retreat from the humdrum and hustle 
bustle of a day-to-day life. The health-giving sea breezes of Arabian Sea forms the western boundary of the city. 
The mountain ranges of Western Ghats set its eastern boundary. This narrow strip of land is also known as a “God’s own country.”
As a tourist, it can become an ideal destination for you because it offers a natural variety. For instance, 
you can find a hill station in Wayanad then you can stay on houseboat inside the backwaters of Kerala and finally you can retire
on a beach to complete the circle. Tourist places in Kerala will give you an experience that will be etched in your memory forever.


    During the last three decades, many factors came into action and helped this state to become a tourist friendly state. 
For instance, this state has a hundred percent literacy rate, people are friendly with Queen's English and this factor 
makes it an international tourist friendly state. Two decades ago, the state also witnessed a migration of educated people 
to western countries. This international migration created a demand for international flights and interconnecting flights 
as a result now Kerala is well connected with air facilities. The reverse migration of this workforce also created an environment 
of investment in the state. This investment pattern also developed a distinct tourism infrastructure where you feel 
the vernacular charms of this state under the amenities of big cities.

Shanti Stupa, and the bustling Leh Market. You can also visit the nearby Shey Palace and Thiksey Monastery.

Nubra Valley: Located about 150 kilometers north of Leh, Nubra Valley is famous for its sand dunes, double-humped camels, 
and picturesque villages. Visit Diskit Monastery and enjoy the breathtaking views from the Khardung La Pass, one of the 
highest motorable passes in the world.

Its pristine blue waters against the backdrop of barren mountains create a surreal landscape. The lake gained popularity after
being featured in the movie "3 Idiots."
