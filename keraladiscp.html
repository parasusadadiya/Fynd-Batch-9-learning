                    The state of Kerala is a secluded haven for the tourists that are seeking a retreat from the humdrum and hustle 
        bustle of a day-to-day life. The health-giving sea breezes of Arabian Sea forms the western boundary of the city. 
        The mountain ranges of Western Ghats set its eastern boundary. This narrow strip of land is also known as a “God’s own country.”
        As a tourist, it can become an ideal destination for you because it offers a natural variety. For instance, 
        you can find a hill station in Wayanad then you can stay on houseboat inside the backwaters of Kerala and finally you can retire
        on a beach to complete the circle. Tourist places in Kerala will give you an experience that will be etched in your memory forever.


            During the last three decades, many factors came into action and helped this state to become a tourist friendly state. 
        For instance, this state has a hundred percent literacy rate, people are friendly with Queen's English and this factor 
        makes it an international tourist friendly state. Two decades ago, the state also witnessed a migration of educated people 
        to western countries. This international migration created a demand for international flights and interconnecting flights 
        as a result now Kerala is well connected with air facilities. The reverse migration of this workforce also created an environment 
        of investment in the state. This investment pattern also developed a distinct tourism infrastructure where you feel 
        the vernacular charms of this state under the amenities of big cities.
