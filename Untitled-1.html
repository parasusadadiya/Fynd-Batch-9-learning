        Majestic trees of Chinar, the Santoor’s mesmerizing sounds, and snow-capped Himalayas make Kashmir a paradise. 
From the stunning vistas of Bhaderwah, picturesque landscapes of Baltal, to photographer’s nirvana like Shalimar 
Garden and apple orchards of Pulwama, Kashmir is waiting to hypnotize you with its mesmerizing aura. All around 
the globe, this small little quaint valley lying between the mountain range of Pir Panjal, and the Himalayan 
Range is known for its pristine beauty and beautiful serenity.

        You can soak infinite memories in a snug Kahwa teacup while enjoying its picture-perfect landscapes.
On the one hand, this place is filled with untouched wild terrain while on the other hand there are 
apple orchards and grasslands of saffron waiting to bloom. Depending on the weather, scenic valleys 
take the form of white ice sheets to luxuriant green valleys that add to the Kashmir tourism in multiple ways.
With the onset of an icy winter, places like Sonmarg get hidden under a snow blanket.

    Hence, the location becomes one of the hotbeds for snow-related adventures that include sledding on glaciers, 
ice-skating, and skiing. But, nothing beats this valley’s charm, especially during the summers, as you can undertake 
a shikara ride, gondola ride, river rafting, and go trekking on popular trekking routes like the Bandipora trek, 
Naranag-Gangabal trek, or Gangabal lake trek. Have you longed to witness the terraced gardens from the Mughal era, 
the vast lake with lotus flowers on the fringes, and the phenomenal alpine vistas? There are some of the most striking 
places to visit in Jammu & Kashmir that you must not miss out on this upcoming summer. So, make your bookings to feel 
the sense of ease, and abundant peace that the “heaven on earth” has to offer.  Read on to know about all that Kashmir 
has in store for you.
